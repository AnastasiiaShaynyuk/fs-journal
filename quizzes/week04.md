# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Synchronous code is executed in a blocking manner, meaning that each statement is executed one after the other, and the program waits for each statement to finish before moving to the next one.
Asynchronous code is executed in a non-blocking manner, meaning that the program can continue to execute while a particular statement is waiting for a result.
