**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process in which you write automated tests for your code before you write the code itself. The idea is to create a suite of automated tests that verify the behavior of your code, and then use those tests to guide the development of the code itself.
