## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the ***handler***?

Get and set.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every `get` to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Return it.

3. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?

The Proxy object allows developers to define custom behavior by intercepting or acting as a Proxy in between for fundamental operations. For instance, you can invoke functions, look up the property of an object, read and write into a property of an object easily with the Proxy object.
