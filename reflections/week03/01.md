## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

We use export to make a module accessible to other parts of our code.

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

Export allows you to export one or more named values from a module, which can be imported by other modules using their exact name.
Export default allows you to export a single value from a module, which can be imported by other modules using any name they want.

3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

- Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality.
- Multiple scripts can be concatenated thereby increasing performance.
- Debugging becomes easier.
- Any code referencing a module understands it is a dependency. If the module file is changed or moved, the problem is immediately obvious.
- Modules (usually) helps eradicate naming conflicts. Function sumAll() in module1 cannot clash with Function sumAll() in module2. Aliases are very useful here, it becomes module1.sumAll() and module2.sumAll().
- ES6 Modules are always executed in strict mode, so there is no need for 'use strict' .
- ES6 modules help you to organize your code better.
