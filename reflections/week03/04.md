> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

It helps to solve the problem of how to efficiently notify many parts of a program when something changes, without making them constantly check for changes.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- Subject
- Observer
- Event

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

Together, these two concepts allow the bcw-template to efficiently manage and update the DOM, by only updating the parts of the view that have actually changed. This leads to a much more performant and responsive user experience, and makes it easier to manage complex applications with a lot of dynamic data.
