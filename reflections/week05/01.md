## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or ‚Äúappending,‚Äù that information to the end of a URL. This information is stored in the query string and is captured by the website when it reads the URL.

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

The query string portion of a URL is the part of the URL after the question mark ?. Each key=value pair is called a query parameter. If your query string has multiple query parameters, they‚Äôre separated by &.

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

They can be helpful when you want to dynamically filter, sort or paginate data, or when you want to provide different views of the same resource.
