## Questions

1. What is a `List` in C#?

A `List` is a generic collection that is used to store a group of related objects of the same type. It provides dynamic resizing, allowing you to add or remove items as necessary. 

2. What `List` methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Add - adds an item to the end of the list.
List.Clear - removes all items from the list. Count is zero, Capacity is unchanged.
List.Contains - returns true if the list contains the specified item.
List.Remove - removes the first occurrence of the specified item from the list.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a `List`? What method could you use?

We can use the List method Find to retrieve an item based on a specific condition. Also we can use the ElementAt method to retrieve an item at a specific index in the list.
