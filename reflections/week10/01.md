## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- Value type - holds a data value within its own memory space;
- Reference type - doesnâ€™t store its value directly. It stores the address where the value is being stored;
- Pointer type - does not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value-type data includes numeric, bool, character, enumerated and struct types. In JavaScript, if you assign an object to a variable, the variable holds a reference to the object's location in memory, not the object's value itself. 

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Value types store their actual value directly in memory, while reference types store a reference to their location in memory.
