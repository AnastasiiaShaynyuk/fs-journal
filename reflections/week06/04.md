## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

 Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You can use nested routes in creating a multiple-level navigation menu: you can have a top-level menu that links to several sub-menus, each of links to additional pages or components.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

We could have routes defined with dynamic segments such as path: '/location/:id'. Then, on the views for those routes we can reference that id as this.$route.params. This is useful when you have more data of a particular type (users, pictures, etc.) that you are wishing to display on your site/app.
