## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- Function Declaration - the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined;
- Function Expressions - are not hoisted, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined;
- Arrow Function Expression - do not create their own this value.


2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition.
Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed.

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it is a higher-order function (Array.prototype.map).
