## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

if you plan ahead it helps you to clarify your ideas, saves time, provides a "roadmap", improves code quality.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google it or ask one of the CodeWorks TA:)

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

For me it would be not taking breaks, not questioning existing code. The whole article was really helpful, especially parts about not targeting the end-user experience and having the wrong attitude about errors.
