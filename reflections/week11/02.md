## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY` 

A PRIMARY KEY is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a FOREIGN KEY is used to establish a relationship between two tables by referring to the PRIMARY KEY of another table.

2. What is an ***alias***?

An alias is created using the "using" directive followed by the alias name and the type or namespace that you want to alias. Once the alias is created, you can use it in your code instead of the original name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT patients.*
FROM patients
JOIN appointments ON patients.id = appointments.patientId
JOIN doctors ON appointments.doctorId = doctors.id
WHERE doctors.id = {doctorId};

```
